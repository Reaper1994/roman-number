# Roman Numerals Tech Task
A simple Api to convert integer to Roman numerals.

## Brief
Our client (Numeral McNumberFace) requires a simple RESTful API which will convert an integer to its Roman numeral counterpart. After our discussions with the client, we have discovered that the solution will contain three API endpoints, and will only support integers ranging from 1 to 3999. The client wishes to keep track of conversions so they can determine which is the most frequently converted integer, and the last time this was converted.

### Endpoints 
1. Accepts an integer, converts it to a Roman numeral, stores it in the database and returns the response.
2. Lists all the recently converted integers.
3. Lists the top 10 converted integers.
